# Boson Prediction Agent Restart Prompt

Use this prompt to restart the GeometricUnity boson-prediction investigation
from the current checkpoint.

## Prompt For The Next Agent

You are working in `/home/josh/Documents/GitHub/GeometricUnity` on the
Geometric Unity boson-prediction/source-law investigation. Continue in the same
style: read the repo first, keep edits scoped, preserve scientific caution, keep
the journal and reference ledger current, validate before committing, and do not
promote W/Z/H masses unless the source-lineage contracts are genuinely filled.

### Operating Rules

- Use `rg`/`rg --files` first for searches.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- Do not revert user or unrelated work. The worktree may be dirty.
- Avoid destructive git commands.
- If broad research or diagnosis is needed and multi-agent tooling is
  available, launch a read-only explorer/subagent and incorporate its findings.
- Keep a running diagnosis journal in
  `docs/BOSON_PREDICTION_DIAGNOSIS_JOURNAL.md`.
- Track references through `ExperimentReferences.md` plus detailed notes under
  `docs/Reference/ExperimentReferences/`.
- Before treating any source as promotion evidence, require exact source
  lineage, observed-field extraction, target independence, pole extraction, and
  GeV/unit normalization.
- If external research is needed, use current primary/official sources where
  possible and add/update reference detail notes before using the source.

### Current Scientific Status

No successful physical W/Z/H prediction has been achieved. The current package
still blocks physical comparison because the source-lineage and observed-field
contracts are empty.

  `flatDirectionObstructionPresent=True` (0.047 per unit kappa),
  `kappaScalingConsistentWithFirstOrder=True`,
  `vo7CoupledStationarityControlComponentDischarged=True`
- Phase400:
  `fullBosonicActionFlatDirectionLiftProbePassed=True`,
  `liftVerdict=all-lifted-with-saddle-directions` (36/36 kernel directions
  lifted, 0 exactly flat, quartic norms 1.2e-3..5.8e-2, saddle depth
  <= 4.5e-19 residual-scale),
  `kernelObstructionFullyRelaxableAtHigherOrder=True`,
  `minObstructionLiftedFraction=1`
- Phase401:

  their trust regions without stationarity; kappa=0 baselines converge to
  2.7e-17),
  `valleyAnisotropyRatio=1.4e8` (positive-relaxed near-null valleys of the
  quartic form), `maxAdiabaticSourceNormGrowth=7.4`
- Phase402:
  `guDraftScalarRouteDictionaryAuditPassed=True`,
  `higgsPotentialIsUpsilonPairingInPrimary=True` (draft eq. 12.28 places
  the Higgs potential at <U,U> and Higgs KG at D*U=0 - the repo's Mode-B
  objective and stationarity, verified at the backgrounds),
  `routeRequiresDoubletEquivalentSubstructure=True` (adjoint-triplet VEV
  cannot produce the SM neutral sector; doublet can),
  `zeroDimensionfulAnchorsInPrimary=True` (no GeV/246 anywhere in the
  primary draft)
- Phase403:
  `adjointDoubletSubstructureBranchingProbePassed=True`,
  `su2AdjointHasNoDoubletBlock=True` (toy branch algebra too small -
  explains the Phase397 underdetermination),
  `su3AdjointContainsConjugateDoubletPair=True` (|Y0| = sqrt(3)/2),

  `couplingRatioLineageMechanismIdentified=True`
- Phase404 (brute force #1 of the user directive):
  `guEmbeddingChainCouplingRatioEnumerationPassed=True`,
  `standardTanSquaredEmb=3/5` (sin^2 = 3/8; derived blind, internal
  lepton-doublet normalization; scan menu over 224 directions),
  `familyPatternDerived=True` (16 -> 1/6, 1/2, 2/3, 1/3, 1, 0),
  `adjointColorSingletChargedDoubletAbsentEverywhere=True` (the SM-Higgs
  doublet CANNOT come from the gauge-adjoint part of the connection on
  this chain - non-adjoint components required)
- Phase405 (brute force #2 of the user directive):
  `vacuumManifoldDoubletVevOrbitScanPassed=True`,
  `vacuumManifoldPermitsConstantDoubletVev=True` (all rank-1 directions
  exactly flat), `flatnessEqualsCommutativity=True` (11 = 11 over 2592
  samples, exact quartic landscape),
  `noSelectionMechanismAtConstantRank1Level=True` (sub-gap (b) open,
  sharpened), `gpuParityDefectDetected=True` (native curvature kernel
  linear-part defect on real mesh topology - platform follow-up; science
  on CPU per IA-5)

Interpretation: the control-branch program has traced every
electroweak-shaped gap to its physical root. The sector skeleton is exact
(Phase396: all 68 triplets split 1 neutral + 1 charged pair). Phase397's
u(1) extension then found: (1) the Z-like channel is SOURCELESS (su(2)-
neutral source fraction <= 0.0023; the coupled residual is purely
charged-sector); (2) the fermion-bilinear neutral mixing element VANISHES
identically (trace selection rule) - photon/Z mixing requires a
symmetry-breaking scalar/VEV sector, welding the Phase256 photon-projection
gap to the Phase201 Higgs scalar-source gap, exactly as in the SM where
W3-B mixing enters through the Higgs; (3) the photon/Z separation is a
one-parameter family blocked by the named gap {hypercharge lineage,
coupling-ratio lineage, scalar sector}. Internal toy-branch construction
has reached its honest limit: the remaining requirements (scalar sector,
hypercharge/coupling lineage, 4D observed vacuum, scale/pole/GeV) all live
in the unsolved GU derivation chain (VO-6/VO-7 physically completed) or new
theorem-level sources.

### Most Recent Implemented Work

The latest work added Phase405 (brute force #2): the su(3) orbit scan of
the Upsilon = 0 vacuum manifold on a 6x6 mesh with closed (exact 1-form)
profiles, so Upsilon = (1/2)[omega wedge omega] exactly and the landscape
is purely bracket-driven. Results: the vacuum manifold PERMITS
doublet-block VEVs (every rank-1 direction exactly flat); flatness
coincides exactly with commutativity (11 = 11 pairs, 2592 samples, exact
quartic shape verified); NO SELECTION MECHANISM exists at this level
(triplet/doublet/singlet treated identically) - scalar-sector sub-gap (b)
confirmed open with sharpened evidence. PLATFORM FINDING: the GPU run
machine-detected a real-mesh topology defect in the native CUDA curvature
kernel's linear (d omega) part (0/27 parity; CPU exactly 0 on closed
profiles, GPU up to 17.5) - the platform's CUDA parity tests used
synthetic topology only; science ran on CPU per IA-5; native
buffer-handle monotonicity also recorded. Study:
`studies/phase405_vacuum_manifold_doublet_vev_orbit_scan_001`
(IMPLEMENTATION_P405.md; reproduce with LD_LIBRARY_PATH=native/build).
NEXT PER DIRECTIVE: Phase406 = choice-space falsification sweep; then
resume the standing research loop.

### Integration Points Already Updated

Phase405 (like Phase388-404) is wired into:

- `scripts/generate_validated_boson_predictions.sh` (both invocation blocks)
- `studies/phase101_boson_prediction_package_001/Program.cs`
- `studies/phase202_boson_objective_completion_audit_001/Program.cs`
  (checklist item
  `vacuum-manifold-doublet-vev-orbit-scan-materialized`)
- `scripts/verify_boson_claim_integrity.sh`
- Broad scanner exclusions: phase204, phase205, phase207, phase279,
  phase281, phase295, phase296

Reference tracking was updated in `ExperimentReferences.md` and
`docs/Reference/ExperimentReferences/LOCAL-COMPLETION-V29-FERMIONIC-YUKAWA.md`
(Phase399/Phase400/Phase401 coupled-stationarity closure section).
The diagnosis journal entry is near the end of
`docs/BOSON_PREDICTION_DIAGNOSIS_JOURNAL.md`.

### Validation Already Run

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=native/build dotnet run --project studies/phase405_vacuum_manifold_doublet_vev_orbit_scan_001/Phase405VacuumManifoldDoubletVevOrbitScan.csproj
dotnet run --project studies/phase101_boson_prediction_package_001/Phase101BosonPredictionPackage.csproj
dotnet run --project studies/phase202_boson_objective_completion_audit_001/Phase202BosonObjectiveCompletionAudit.csproj
./scripts/verify_boson_claim_integrity.sh
./scripts/generate_validated_boson_predictions.sh
```

The full generator ended with the Phase405 line, the Phase202 incomplete
status (`checklistPassedCount=198`, `checklistFailedCount=3`), and the same
claim-integrity status (`promotedPhysicalMassClaimCount=0`). All seven broad
scanners still report zero intake-ready evidence.

### Current Reference Structure

`ExperimentReferences.md` is the top-level source ledger. Each row should have
a linked detail note under `docs/Reference/ExperimentReferences/`.

When adding or revisiting a source:

1. Add/update the row in `ExperimentReferences.md`.
2. Add/update the linked detail note.
3. Record how the source was used.
4. State exactly what source-lineage fields it can and cannot supply.
5. Update `docs/BOSON_PREDICTION_DIAGNOSIS_JOURNAL.md` when it changes the
   diagnosis or confirms a negative boundary.

Important current local detail notes:

- `LOCAL-COMPLETION-V29-FERMIONIC-YUKAWA.md`
- `LOCAL-ARCH-P4-FERMION-MASS-REPRESENTATION.md`
- `DIRAC-SHELL-RESPONSE-BOUNDARY.md`
- `COX-FIRST-PRINCIPLES-I-19800512.md`
- `TOE-GU-ICEBERG-20250423.md` (+ full transcript under
  `docs/Reference/ExperimentReferences/transcripts/`): the GU-native
  structural ansatz for the scalar/Yukawa gap rows - qualitative only;
  cite GU-DRAFT-2021 as primary

### Best Next Work

Do not try to promote another numerical near-pass. The next useful work must
either find or derive a theorem-level artifact that can fill the missing
contract fields, or remove a physical blocker on the VO-7 branch.

USER DIRECTIVE (2026-06-11): the next several phases are the three
brute-force computations, run on the local GPU where the problem size
warrants it (RTX 4080 SUPER, CUDA 13.3, repo native lib
`native/build/libgu_cuda_core.so` verified functional via
gu_cuda_device_init): Phase404 = exhaustive GU embedding-chain
enumeration with the derived coupling-ratio menu (CPU - objects are
10x10; GPU adds nothing); Phase405 = vacuum-manifold doublet-VEV orbit
scan on larger algebras with GPU Hessian spectra; Phase406 =
choice-space falsification sweep, GPU batch-parallel. After these three,
resume the standing research loop below.

Phase405 design (ready to implement): su(3)-valued connections (the
minimal doublet-bearing algebra per Phase403) on a LARGER structured
fiber-bundle mesh (rows=cols=6+ for a carrier in the thousands);
question: does the Upsilon = 0 vacuum manifold's local structure permit/
select doublet-block VEV directions? (1) GN Hessian spectrum at the
trivial vacuum, kernel/soft directions classified by the su(2)xu(1)
block decomposition (triplet/doublet/singlet); (2) brute-force orbit
scan: S_B evaluated exactly over a dense sample of doublet-block VEV
directions x magnitudes, landscape mapped in gauge-invariant orbit
coordinates; (3) GPU: Gu.Interop.GpuSolverBackend implements
ISolverBackend with algebra-generic EvaluateDerived (curvature/torsion/
Shiab/residual) - run the thousands of independent evaluations on the
GPU (CudaNativeBackend; native lib verified) with CPU-parity gates on a
subsample and recorded speedup; check whether BuildJacobian/
ComputeGradient are GPU-implemented (header comment may be stale - Phase
I GAP-4/8 added CUDA Stage 2/3 Jacobian/Krylov) and fall back to CPU for
those pieces if not, honestly recorded.

The most useful next branches are:

1. The physical VO-6/VO-7 derivation against the Phase398 8-item gap
   ledger, headed by the symmetry-breaking scalar/VEV sector (welded to
   photon/Z mixing by Phase397) and the hypercharge/coupling lineage. Each
   component solved should arrive through a new fail-closed phase that
   names the Phase398 ledger row it discharges, proves target independence,
   and lets the existing gates decide promotion. The scalar-route audit
   against the primary draft is DONE (Phase402): the draft's eq. 12.28
   dictionary pins the Higgs potential to <U,U> (= the repo's Mode-B
   objective) and Higgs KG to D*U=0; symmetry breaking must come from the
   Upsilon = 0 locus geometry; the scalar-sector row is now three named
   sub-gaps: (a) a doublet-equivalent substructure inside the pulled-back
   connection component (the adjoint-triplet pattern cannot produce the
   SM neutral sector - machine-verified discriminator), (b) the
   vacuum-manifold breaking geometry on a physical branch, (c) the
   quantitative chain (VEV scale/pole/GeV - zero anchors exist in the
   primary). The doublet-substructure probe is DONE (Phase403): doublet
   blocks exist generically in larger adjoints with the custodial pattern
   exact and the coupling ratio EMBEDDING-DERIVED (tan^2 = 3 for the
   su(3) toy, recorded blind) - the ratio-lineage mechanism is
   identified. Candidate next internal work: compute the GU-SPECIFIC
   branching chain (the draft's spin(6,4)/su(3,2) -> SM reduction, per
   the stored text and the Iceberg analysis section on the embedding
   paths) and its embedding-derived coupling ratio, fail-closed and
   recorded blind; separately, the vacuum-manifold mechanism that selects
   a doublet-block VEV on the Upsilon = 0 locus.
2. (CLOSED by Phase399 + Phase400 + Phase401: the quadratic-model coupled
   critical point is solved modulo flat directions, every flat ray is
   quartically lifted, and the attempted construction of the relaxed
   critical point machine-characterized the kernel relaxation as
   NON-PERTURBATIVE - positive-relaxed near-null valleys of the quartic
   form (anisotropy 1.4e8) plus adiabatic source growth carry the
   relaxation out of every trust region. No internal question remains for
   this component; the "4D observed vacuum" gap-ledger row now carries the
   Phase401 boundary evidence.)
3. Periodic external literature monitoring at checkpoint cadence (the
   2026-06-10 survey and the 2026-06-11 post-Phase400 sweep found no
   GU-native scalar-sector source; the 2026-06-11 sweep catalogued
   arXiv:2503.14578, G2-RICCI-FLOW-TORSION-EWSB, which imports the 246 GeV
   scale and weak angle - the negative boundary stands; the internal
   toy-branch construction otherwise reached its honest limit).

If a source or new derivation appears to satisfy any of these, create a new
fail-closed phase rather than editing Phase201/Phase256 directly. The phase
should prove target independence, check every required contract field, and then
let the existing gates decide whether promotion is allowed.
